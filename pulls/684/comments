## PR Review — Closing Rationale

This PR was reviewed and closed for the following reasons:

### 1. PR Does Not Address the Linked Issue
This PR claims to fix #682, which is a feature request to **document and enforce a single-commit-per-PR policy**. That issue requires updates to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, and potentially CI enforcement — none of which are present here. Instead, this PR claims to be "automated typo and formatting fixes," which is entirely unrelated to issue #682.

### 2. Misleading Description
The PR body states:
- "Fixed 0 typos" — fixing zero typos is not a fix
- "Fixed 749 files with trailing whitespace" — but only **19 files** were actually changed
- 273 additions and 273 deletions (a perfect 1:1 ratio)

These inconsistencies between the claimed scope and the actual changes raise concerns about what the PR actually modifies.

### 3. Unverified, First-Time Contributor
- The author (`kambrosgroup`) is a **first-time contributor** with no prior history in this repository
- The commit is **unverified** (no GPG/SSH signature)
- The PR appears to be generated by an automated bot/script ("*Generated by Karl Ambrosius* 🤖")

### 4. Unsolicited Automated PR
This PR was not requested, discussed in an issue, or coordinated with the maintainers. Mass-opening automated "cleanup" PRs on public repositories without prior discussion is generally considered poor open-source etiquette.
