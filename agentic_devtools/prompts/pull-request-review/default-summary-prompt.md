# Pull Request Review - Summary Step

All files in Pull Request **#{{pull_request_id}}** have been reviewed.

## Review Statistics

- **Files Reviewed**: {{completed_count}}
- **Approvals**: {{approval_count}}
- **Change Requests**: {{changes_count}}

## Your Task

The PR summary is now generated automatically during `agdt-review-pull-request` scaffolding.

The summary:

1. **Groups findings by folder/area** for easy navigation
2. **Highlights critical issues** that must be addressed
3. **Notes positive aspects** and good patterns observed
4. **Provides actionable recommendations**

## Next Action

Wait for the auto-generated summary to complete:

```bash
agdt-task-wait
```

This will wait for the summary to complete and then provide next steps.
