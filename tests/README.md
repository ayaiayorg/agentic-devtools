# Test Organization Policy

This document defines the strict 1:1:1 test organization policy for `agentic-devtools`.
All new tests **must** follow this policy. No exceptions are allowed.

## Policy

- **One folder per source file under test** — the test directory structure mirrors the source structure.
- **One test file per function under test** — each test file covers exactly one function.

## Directory Structure

```text
tests/unit/{module_path}/{source_file_name}/test_{function_name}.py
```

### Example

| Source | Test |
|--------|------|
| `agentic_devtools/cli/git/core.py` → `get_current_branch()` | `tests/unit/cli/git/core/test_get_current_branch.py` |
| `agentic_devtools/state.py` → `get_value()` | `tests/unit/state/test_get_value.py` |
| `agentic_devtools/cli/jira/config.py` → `get_jira_url()` | `tests/unit/cli/jira/config/test_get_jira_url.py` |

## Rules

1. The path under `tests/unit/` **must** mirror the path under `agentic_devtools/` exactly
   (drop the `agentic_devtools/` prefix and strip the `.py` extension to form the folder name).
2. The test file **must** be named `test_{function_name}.py` where `{function_name}` is the
   name of the single function under test.
3. **Each test file tests exactly one function.** If a source file has ten functions, it will
   have ten corresponding test files inside its folder.
4. Every directory in the hierarchy **must** contain an `__init__.py` file so pytest can
   resolve imports correctly.

## Enforcement

A CI validation script (`scripts/validate_test_structure.py`) automatically checks that
every file inside `tests/unit/` obeys the rules above. The script exits with a non-zero
status if any violation is found, causing the CI build to fail.

To run the validator locally:

```bash
python scripts/validate_test_structure.py
```

## Linting Requirements

All test files under `tests/unit/` must pass `ruff` linting. Common pitfalls to avoid:

1. **No unused imports (F401):** Each test file should only import what it actually uses.
   Ruff will flag any import that is never referenced in the file. Run `ruff check tests/unit/`
   or `ruff check tests/unit/ --fix` to auto-remove them.

2. **Sorted imports (I001):** Imports must be sorted (isort-style). The project uses
   `known-first-party = ["agentic_devtools", "agdt_ai_helpers"]`. Run `ruff check tests/unit/ --fix`
   to auto-sort them.

3. **No trailing whitespace:** Blank lines inside function/class bodies must not contain
   spaces. Ruff's `W291`/`W293` rules catch this. Use `ruff format` or `ruff check --fix` to clean up.

4. **Do not commit `agentic_devtools/_version.py`:** This file is auto-generated by
   setuptools-scm and must never be committed. It changes on every git operation. If
   `git status` shows it as modified, do **not** stage or commit it.

Run the full linting check before pushing:

```bash
ruff check tests/unit/
```

## Existing Tests

Tests outside `tests/unit/` (e.g., `tests/azure_devops/`, `tests/e2e_smoke/`, and the
flat `tests/test_*.py` files) were written before this policy was introduced. They are
**not** validated by the 1:1:1 script and do not need to be migrated immediately.
New test code, however, **must** be placed under `tests/unit/`.
